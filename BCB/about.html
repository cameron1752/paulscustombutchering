    <h3>Get to know us</h3>
    <p>
        We pride ourselves on reliable delivery, quality products, and accommodating the special needs of our 
        customers. Our current customer base consists of delivery to campgrounds, convenient stores, delis, farm 
        and garden stores, and traditional bait and tackle shops.  We deliver to our locally based PA stops on 
        Wednesday, NY Area on Thursdays, and further reaching areas of PA on Fridays.  Weekend deliveries are 
        not normally available, however, there are certain occasions in which we make exceptions in order to 
        meet special needs of our clients.

    <h3>Where we come from</h3>
    <p>
        Our family has been in the live bait industry for over 70 years, passed down among three generations.  
        Theodore Knickerbocker started out in a little shop in Mt. Cobb selling hand-picked worms to the public. 
        His son Ted Knickerbocker continued this for many years, eventually growing to serve only as a wholesale 
        distributor, well known and loved in the local industry.  Before Ted’s passing in 2008, he passed down his 
        knowledge and some of his customer base to James Webster who is the face of Butternut Creek Bait, with Ted’s 
        daughter, Denise Knickerbocker, hiding in the wings administratively. James has since taken on many more new 
        clients, serving a total of 72 clients in the region.
