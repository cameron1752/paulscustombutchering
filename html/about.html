                <h2>What is custom butchering?</h2>
                <p>
                    Custom butchering is personal butchering for livestock.  Custom butchering is not intended for public sale or resale, but is 
                    aimed towards a local farmer ready to cash in on his herd, or a local 4-H club.  If you've just bought an animal at an auction
                    you've come to the right place to have it butchered!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon arival your animal will be kept in our temperature controlled coolers and personally cut to your specifications 
                    by Paul Simyan.

                <p>
                    After we cut the animal, the meat is vacuum packed, labeled, then flash frozen and boxed, and it's ready for your pickup.

                    Paul Simyan grew up here in Jefferson Township PA on his family's dairy farm.  Paul has been in the butchering game 
                    for over 30 years and counting.  Excited to put his experience to the test, him and his wife Joann started their 
                    own operation and have been succesfully growing since 2014.  We are a proud local business, and we gladly support the local
                    4-H clubs and farmers in the Northeast Region.
